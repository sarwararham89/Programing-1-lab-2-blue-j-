It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.
Question 2: the balance comes back to 0. 
Question 3 : when you put a high amount of money it wont generate that money and when u put a low amount it still does the same thing, it wont let you generate. I didnt receive any refunds. 
Question 5: the printTicket looks different because it shows the get price initials when you created a new ticketMachine.
Question 7: when its in public class TicketMachine, it doesnt say any errors but when i put class public we see a change or background color meaning that the brackets dont have any rol there and that the code isnt correct.
Question 8: its possible to leave out public. 
Question 9: its not possible to leave out class, it shows many code errors.
Question 10: the fields are: private int price; private int balance;private int total. the constructors is the public TicketMachine and the methods are getPrice;getBalance;setBalance;InsertMoney;printTicket. 
Question 11: the int or void isnt placed after the public which makes it different from others and makes it into the constructors and that the methods names are different from the class name.
Question 12: the types of fields are int and if its a upercase letter, it turns it into a class. 
Question 13: private boolean alive; name is alive since its followed by the type. private Person tutor; name is tutor. private Game game; name is game.
Question 14: No they are not classes. why? because a class isnt a type.  
Question 15: 15.1; yes it does mather because it has a structor to follow meaning that the visability modifier comes first and then the type and finally the variable name. 15.2; No it doesnt give any clue. 15.3; it gives me an error because it isnt the rigth structor of code. 
Question 16: Yes it is necessary to have the semicolon because it marks the end of an decleration. 
Question 18: public Student
Question 19: String title, double price. 
Question 20: 20.1; yes 20.2:yes 20.3:yes 
Question 21: name = petName;
Question 22: public Date (int month, int day, int year); 
Question 23: The difference between the headers is that they are two different method names, and the difference between the bodies are that they have two different return names.
Question 24: A call for getbalance would characterize has "how many balance do i have left?" 
Question 25: This change doesnt show any error because it doesnt mather 
Question 27; it shows that it isnt a statement. 
Question 28: For the getPrice we see that the structor is " public int getPrice()" and in printTicket its " public void printTicket()" the difference is the return type. 
Question 29: No they dont have because the return type " void " doesnt have any return statements. 
Question 30: So after inserting the amount in insertMoney, we can see that this amount was transfered to the getbalance. 
Question 31: /**
* Increase score by the given number of points.
*/
public void increaseScore(int points)
{
      score = score + points
// TODO: Increase score by the value in points.
}
Question 32: Yes it a mutator because it modify a state of an object. 
Question 33: /**
*/
* Reduce price by the given amount.
public void discount(int amount)
{
   dicount = discount - price
// TODO: Subtract amount from price.
}
Question 34: private int age( int currentAge) 
{ 
  age = currentAge 
} 
Question 35: private boolean alive() 
{ 
  alive = alive
} 
Question 36: When i inspect the TicketMachine, the private int price gives me 0 even if i put the cost at 67. 
Question 37: My cat has green eyes. 
Question 39: ##################
# The BlueJ Line
# Ticket
# price cents.
##################   It will print this meaning that the price is now showing with the cents. 
Question 40: ##################
# The BlueJ Line
# Ticket
#price cents.
##################    It shows the same thing but there is one difference, there isnt any space between hashtag and price. 
Question 42: They show the same output of 0 cents because of step number 36. 
Question 43: No it doesnt have the same output. 43.1; these mean that it changes into cents.
Question 44: After modifying it, we can see that it doesnt show how much amount we should put since it was modifyed to 1000 cents. 
Question 45: first one is at 1000 cents since its already set to that value while in the otherhand even if you had a value it doesnt had nothing. 
Question 46:
