It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.
Question 2: the balance comes back to 0. 
Question 3 : when you put a high amount of money it wont generate that money and when u put a low amount it still does the same thing, it wont let you generate. I didnt receive any refunds. 
Question 5: the printTicket looks different because it shows the get price initials when you created a new ticketMachine.
Question 7: when its in public class TicketMachine, it doesnt say any errors but when i put class public we see a change or background color meaning that the brackets dont have any rol there and that the code isnt correct.
Question 8: its possible to leave out public. 
Question 9: its not possible to leave out class, it shows many code errors.
Question 10: the fields are: private int price; private int balance;private int total. the constructors is the public TicketMachine and the methods are getPrice;getBalance;setBalance;InsertMoney;printTicket. 
Question 11: the int or void isnt placed after the public which makes it different from others and makes it into the constructors and that the methods names are different from thr class name.
Question 12: the types of fields are int and if its a upercase letter, it turns it into a class. 
Question 13: so for the first one its an int because of the lowercase letter and the two others represent a class since their letter are a upercase.
